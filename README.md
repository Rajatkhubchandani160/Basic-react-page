# Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

## üöÄ Description

This project is a basic Next.js with React application that demonstrates a dynamic desktop screen with two layers: background and foreground. The background layer serves as a static backdrop, while the foreground layer contains  draggable blocks implemented using Framer Motion. These draggable blocks can be easily moved around the screen, providing an interactive user experience. Tailwind CSS is used for rapid styling, and Framer Motion powers smooth animations and drag functionality. This project serves as a starting point for developers looking to explore the integration of Next.js and React with external libraries like Framer Motion to create engaging user interfaces.


## Features

- **Two-layered desktop screen design**: Background and foreground layers for enhanced visual experience.
- **Draggable blocks**: Interact with draggable blocks on the foreground layer.
